# About me

{{< profile-figure src="images/foto-perfil.jpg" >}}

<p style="font-size: 22px">
    Researcher at SENAI Institute of Inovation /<br> 
    Data Scientist<br>
    Master's Student at PPGEEL (UFSC)<br>
</p>

Hey, I'm Rodrigo! An AI Researcher at the SENAI Institute of Inovation in Embedded Systems and an Electronic Engineer with a keen interest in the application of machine learning models in the industry. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Applied Machine Learning at [UFSC](https://ppgeel.posgrad.ufsc.br/), I am dedicated to enhancing industrial efficiency through data-driven solutions.
                        
Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in Python programming and machine learning techniques. My expertise lies in developing innovative algorithms and implementing machine learning models for real-world applications. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive advancements in the industry.
