# About me

{{< profile-figure src="images/foto-perfil.jpg" >}}

<p style="font-size: 22px">
    Researcher at SENAI Institute of Innovation /<br> 
    Data Scientist<br>
    M.Sc in Electrical Engineering<br>
</p>

Hey, this is Rodrigo! I'm an AI Researcher at the SENAI Institute of Innovation in Embedded Systems and an Electronic Engineer with a keen interest in the application of machine learning models in the industry. . I hold a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [UFSC](https://ppgeel.posgrad.ufsc.br/), where I conducted studies on machine learning applied to industry in collaboration with a company. My main professional goal is to enhance industrial efficiency through data-driven solutions.

Over the past five years, I have been improving my skills in Python programming and machine learning techniques. At the same time, I have also been developing expertise in innovation project management through technical leadership in projects at the SENAI Institute of Innovation. My expertise lies in developing innovative algorithms and implementing machine learning models in real-world applications. I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to drive advancements in the industry.
